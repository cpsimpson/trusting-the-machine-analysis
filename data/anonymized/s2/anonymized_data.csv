This letter explains what the study is about, possible risks and benefits, and your rights as a research participant. You may print/save a copy for your records. If you do not understand something in the letter, please contact one of the investigators named above before consenting to participate.



What is the study about?

You are invited to participate in an undergraduate research study about perceptions of communicated information. The purpose of the study is to find out what impacts perception of information communicated through written content. This is important because we live in a world where more communication is happening asynchronously through online media and perceptions can impact knowledge sharing.



What does participation involve?

Participation in the study will consist of an online anonymous questionnaire that takes approximately 30 minutes. You will first be asked to read a blog post. Then you will interact with the generative AI bot that authored the post. You will then be asked some questions about the content, and your perceptions of it and the author. You will also be asked a series of questions related to your technology use. Finally, you will be asked some demographic questions (i.e. age, education level, gender, and sex) which will be used to describe the characteristics of participants in this study as well as to examine differences and trends across these characteristics.



Who may participate in the study?

To participate in the study, you need to be fluent in English.



Is participation in the study voluntary?

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any question(s) you prefer not to answer by skipping to the next question and may stop participating at any time by not submitting your responses and closing your web browser. Once data has been collected, you may request your data be removed from the study up until 30 days from the day of your participation by contacting one of the researchers above with your unique completion code.



Will I receive anything for participating in the study?

If you participate in this study, you will receive 0.5 credits. If you decide to stop participating early, please click through to the end to receive credit.



What are the possible benefits of the study?

Participation in this study will not provide any personal benefit to you. Data from this study may contribute to theoretical knowledge about cognition and how our brains work.



What are the risks associated with the study?

There are no known or anticipated risks associated with participation in this study. If a question or the topic makes you uncomfortable, you can choose not to provide a response.



How is data collected, stored, and protected?

Your identity will be confidential. Furthermore, because the interest of this study is in the average responses of the entire group of participants, you will not be identified individually in any way in any written reports of this research.



This survey is hosted by Qualtrics, which has multiple safeguards in place, although no Internet transmission is ever fully secure. Please Note: We do not collect or use internet protocol (IP) addresses or other information which could link your participation to your computer or electronic device.

You will interact with a third-party generative AI platform. We do not send any identifying information to this platform. You should not disclose personal information in the chat. In accordance with the platform’s privacy policy, the platform may retain chat logs for 30 days and will not use chat contents for the purpose of training AI except in extenuating circumstances, such as violation of policies.

The collected research data, with identifying information removed, will be securely stored on secure University of Waterloo Servers or as needed, on encrypted external drives, for a minimum of seven years, and will be accessible to members of the research team only.



The data that you provide in this study may be submitted to an online repository and / or journal (i.e., the data may be publicly available). These data will be completely deidentified/anonymized prior to submission and will be presented in aggregate form in publications. This process is integral to the research process as it allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research. Though the data is posted for the purpose listed, other individuals may access these data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset without identifiers may be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential. If you do not want to have your data used in this manner, do not consent to participate in this study.



Has the study received ethics clearance?



This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board (REB [#47304]) If you have questions for the Board, contact the Office of Research Ethics, toll-free at 1-833-643-2379 (Canada and USA), 1-519-888-4440, or reb@uwaterloo.ca.



Who should I contact if I have questions regarding my participation in the study?

If you have any questions about this study or need more information before you decide whether to participate, please contact one of the researchers named above.
