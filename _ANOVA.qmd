Analysis of Variance of `r y_label` by `r x_label`

Let's try with an ANOVA

```{r}
aov_model <- aov(formula = formula, data = data)
summary(aov_model)
```


Follow-up tests to identify where variance is located

```{r}
pairwise.t.test(y, x,  p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

But we should test assumptions for the ANOVA before we use these results

First test for normality

```{r}
# Test for Normality
hist(y)

qqnorm(aov_model$residuals)
qqline(aov_model$residuals)

shapiro.test(y)
```

Next test for equal variance

```{r}
# Test for Equal Variance
boxplot(formula, xlab = x_label, ylab = y_label, data = data)
bartlett.test(formula, data = data)
```
